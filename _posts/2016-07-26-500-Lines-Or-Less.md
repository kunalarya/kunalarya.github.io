title: 500 Lines Or Less
---
[The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) 
collects many usable, yet easy-to-grasp, projects together, all of which are
fewer than 500 lines in total. The hit a good balance between complexity and
digestibility, specifically demonstrating a computationally feasible solution
(e.g. the job shop scheduler uses simulated annealing).
