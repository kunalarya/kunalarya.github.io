I am a computer engineer with a strong computer science background. My
interests span embedded systems, FPGA development, software architecture, and
language/compiler design. This includes automated design in mixed
hardware/software environments (primarily reconfigurable embedded systems/SoCs). I
have dabbled with correctness/verification through SAT, BDD, and model checking
techniques, and enjoy language/compiler design.

### Background

I started programming with QBasic and eventually
discovered my love for computer engineering and hardware description languages as an
undergraduate. This experience culminated in the EPTSM project at the [Santa
Cruz Institute for Particle Physics](http://scipp.ucsc.edu/), a silicon
calibration system used to measure radiation damage for the 2020
[ATLAS](http://www.atlas.ch/) sensor upgrade at the LHC.

In 2007, I entered the M.S./Ph.D. program working with [Professor Forrest
Brewer](http://bears.ece.ucsb.edu/) at UC Santa Barbara. There, we focused on
research on design automation of heterogeneous architectures, particularly
reconfigurable embedded FPGAs.

I have enjoyed working with [Fifth Gait Technologies](http://fifthgait.com/) on
novel architectures for image processing algorithms for atmospheric distortion
mitigation, and have worked with [Aurrion, Inc.](http://www.aurrion.com) across
a variety of functional groups. I am currently part of the quantum hardware
team at Google.
